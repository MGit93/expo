When you create your first React Native project with `npx create-expo-app` and run it with `npx expo start`, you are most likely using the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app for development. Expo Go is a native app that we built and deployed to the [App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) and [Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) stores so you could get coding quickly. It is a sandbox app with a number of native libraries packaged in (see the dependencies list [here](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/main/apps/expo-go/package.json#L23)). This means that you can develop the JavaScript side of your app locally and view it on Expo Go.

A React Native app consists of two parts: the **native app (Expo Go)** and the **JavaScript bundle (`npx expo start`)**.

The **native app (Expo Go)** is immutable once installed. Native build tools are required to create this bundle, and it needs to be signed in order to be installable on real devices. In order to add a new library with native code or change metadata that is shipped with the app (e.g. app name, icon, splash screen) the app needs to be rebuilt and re-installed on the device.

The **JavaScript bundle (`npx expo start`)** is where your app's UI code and business logic is. In a production apps there is one `main.js` bundle that is shipped with the app itself. In development this JS bundle is live reloaded from your local machine. The main role of React Native is to provide a way for the JavaScript code to access the native APIs (Image, Camera, Notifications etc). But only APIs and libraries that were bundled in the **native app** can be used.

Since the native app bundle is immutable, this means that when you're using Expo Go for development, you can only rely on the native code and tools that exist in Expo Go. The only way to get around it is to build your native app yourself instead of using our pre-packaged sandbox. This is exactly what a **Development Build is: your own version of Expo Go** where you are free to use any native libraries and change any native config.

## What can't you do in Expo Go and why

Migrating from Expo Go to a Development Build can be a bit overwhelming the first time. Expo Go is the perfect tool for learning, prototyping and experimenting, but most production apps will convert to using Development builds sooner rather than later. It helps to know exactly what is _not_ possible in Expo Go and _why_, so you can make an informed decision on when and why to make this move.

### Use libraries with native code that aren't in Expo Go

Take [react-native-webview](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/webview/) for example. This library contains native code, but it [is included in Expo Go](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/main/apps/expo-go/package.json#L23). So when you `npx expo install react-native-webview` on your project, it will install the library in your `node_modules` which includes both the JS code and the native code. But the JS bundle you are building _only_ uses the JS code. Then your JS bundle gets uploaded to Expo Go, and it interacts with the native code that was already bundled with the app.

If instead you tried to use a library that is not included, e.g. [react-native-firebase](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/using-firebase/#using-react-native-firebase), then you can use the JS code and hot reload the new bundle into Expo Go but it will immediately error because the JS code is trying to call into the native code from the React Native Firebase package that does not exist in Expo Go. There is no way to get the native code into the Expo Go app unless it was already included in the bundle that was uploaded to the App / Play Store.

### Test changes in app icon, name, splash screen

If you're developing your app in Expo Go only, you _can_ build a store version of it that will use your provided values and images for there, it just won't be possible to test it in Expo Go.

All of these are native assets that get shipped with the native bundle and are immutable once installed. The Expo Go app does show a "splash screen which" which is just your app icon on a solid color background. This is a dev-only emulation of a splash screen we added so you could see what the splash screen will probably look like. It is limited however, e.g. you cannot test `SplashScreen.setOptions` to animate the splash screen.

### Remote push notifications

While in-app [notifications](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/) are available in Expo Go, remote push notifications (that is, sending a push notification from a server into the app) are not. This is because a push notification service should be tied to your own push notifications certificates and while it is possible to make it work in Expo Go, it often caused confusion for production builds. It is therefore better to test remote push notifications in Development Builds so you can ensure parity in behavior between development and production.

### Universal Links / App Links

Both [iOS Universal Links](https://docs.expo.dev/linking/ios-universal-links/) and [Android App Links](https://docs.expo.dev/linking/android-app-links/) require a two-way association between the native app and the website. In particular, it requires for the native app ro include the URL for the lined website. This is not possible with Expo Go due to the aforementioned native code immutability.

### (iOS Device only) open projects using older SDKs

Expo Go can only support one SDK version at a time. So, when we release a new SDK version we need to update Expo Go to support the new SDK version and this will be the only version of Expo Go available to install from the stores.

If you're developing on Android Device, Android Emulator or iOS Simulator, a compatible version of Expo Go can be [downloaded and installed](https://expo.dev/go). The only platform where this is not possible is iPhone devices because apple does not support side-loading older versions of apps.

## How to convert from Expo Go to a Development build

To migrate from Expo Go, you'll need to

1. install `expo-dev-client`
2. build the native app using native build tools

The details on how to do this based on the platform you're building for is covered in the [next section](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build).

The Expo Dev Client package includes the launcher UI (shown in the screenshots below), dev menu, extensions to test updates etc. The Expo Go app has the dev menu built in, so we'll need to install it ourselves for a development build.
