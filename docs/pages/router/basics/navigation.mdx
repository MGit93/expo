Once you have a few pages in your app and their layouts setup, it's time to start navigating between them. Navigation in Expo Router works a lot like React Navigation, but with all pages having a URL by default, we can create links and use these URL's to move about our app using familiar web patterns.

## Native navigation basics with `useRouter`

Like in React Navigation, you can call a function from an `onPress` handler to navigate to another page. In Expo Router, you can use the `useRouter` hook to access navigation functions:

```tsx
import { useRouter } from 'expo-router';

export default function Home() {
  const router = useRouter();

  return <Button onPress={() => router.navigate('/about')}>Go to About</Button>;
}
```

Expo Router apps default to stack navigation, where navigating to a new route pushes a screen onto a stack, and backing out of that route pops it off the stack. Usually, you would want to use the `router.navigate` function. This will either push a new page onto the stack or unwinding to an existing route on the stack. However, you can also call `router.push` to explicitly push a new page onto the stack, `router.back` to go back to the previous page, or `router.replace` to replace the current page on the stack.

With Expo Router, you refer to pages by their URL, or their position relative to the **app** folder. Check out the following file structure and how you would navigate to each page:

<FileTree
  files={[
    ['app/index.tsx', '`router.navigate("/")`'],
    ['app/about.tsx', '`router.navigate("/about")`'],
    ['app/profile/index.tsx', '`router.navigate("/profile")`'],
    ['app/profile/friends.tsx', '`router.navigate("/profile/friends")`'],
  ]}
/>

## Links and Buttons

However, the typical way to link to a page in Expo Router is to use links, just like web apps. Expo Router has `Link` components for navigating between pages, where the `href` is the same route you would use in `router.navigate`:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```tsx app/index.tsx
import { View } from 'react-native';
/* @info Import the <strong>Link</strong> React component from <strong>expo-router</strong> */
import { Link } from 'expo-router';
/* @end */

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <View>
      /* @info Tapping this will link to the <strong>about</strong> page */
      <Link href="/about">About</Link>
    </View>
  );
}
```

By default, Links can only wrap `Text` components. You can use `Pressable` or other components that support `onPress` and `onClick` props inside a link with the `asChild` prop:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```tsx
import { Pressable, Text } from 'react-native';
import { Link } from 'expo-router';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    /* @info The <strong>onPress</strong> event that navigates to <strong>/other</strong> will be passed to <strong>Pressable</strong> */
    <Link href="/other" asChild>
    /* @end */
      <Pressable>
        <Text>Home</Text>
      </Pressable>
    </Link>
  );
}
```

## Relative routes

You don't always have to use the absolute path to a route. Using paths that start with `./` (for the current folder) or `../` (for the parent folder) will navigate relative to the current route.

A relative URL is a URL prefix with `./`, such as `./article`, or `./article/`. Relative URLs are resolved relative to the current rendered screen.

```tsx
<Link href="./article">Go to article</Link>
```

```ts
router.navigate('./article');
```

## Dynamic routes and URL parameters

Dynamic routes can be linked to with their full URL, or by passing a `params` object.

Consider this file structure:

<FileTree files={[['app/user/[id].tsx']]} />

Each of these links will navigate to the same page:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```tsx app/index.tsx
/* @info Import the <strong>Link</strong> React component from <strong>expo-router</strong> */
import { Link } from 'expo-router';
/* @end */
import { View, Pressable } from 'react-native';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Link
        href="/user/bacon">
        View user (id inline)
      </Link>
      <Link
        href={{
          /* @info Navigate to <strong>/user/bacon</strong> */
          pathname: '/user/[id]',
          params: { id: 'bacon' }
          /* @end */
        }}>
        View user (id in params in href)
      </Link>
      <Pressable onPress={() => router.navigate('/user', { id: 'bacon' })}>
        <Text>View user (imperative)</Text>
      </Pressable>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Passing query parameters

You can specify query parameters in the link URL itself, or as additional parameters in the `params` object. Any parameters that don't match the name of the dynamic route variable are equivalent to query parameters.

```tsx
<Link href="/users?limit=20">View users</Link>

<Link
  href={{
    pathname: '/users',
    params: { limit: 20 }
  }}>
  View users
</Link>
```

### Using dynamic route variables and query parameters

All variables in the link URL are accessible to the receiving page via the `useLocalSearchParams` hook. This hook returns an object with all the URL parameters, including those passed as `params`.

So, if you have a link like this:

```tsx
<Link href="/users?limit=20">View users</Link>
```

Then you can read the parameters on the other end like this:

```tsx
import { useLocalSearchParams } from 'expo-router';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

export default function Users() {
  const { id, limit } = useLocalSearchParams();

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>User ID: {id}</Text>
      <Text>Limit: {limit}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Update query parameters

Query parameters can be updated without navigating to a new page. This can be done with a `Link` that uses the same URL as the current page, but with updated query parameters, or imperatively.

```tsx
<Link href="/users?limit=50">View more users</Link>

<Pressable onPress={() => router.setParams({ limit: 50 })}>
  <Text>View more users</Text>
</Pressable>
