Once you have a few pages in your app and their layouts setup, it's time to start navigating between them. Navigation in Expo Router works a lot like React Navigation, but with all pages having a URL by default, we can create links and use these URL's to move about our app using familiar web patterns.

## Native navigation basics with `useRouter`

Like in React Navigation, you can call a function from an `onPress` handler to navigate to another page. In Expo Router, you can use the `useRouter` hook to access navigation functions:

```tsx
import { useRouter } from 'expo-router';

export default function Home() {
  const router = useRouter();

  return <Button onPress={() => router.navigate('/about')}>Go to About</Button>;
}
```

Expo Router apps default to stack navigation, where navigating to a new route pushes a screen onto a stack, and backing out of that route pops it off the stack. Usually, you would want to use the `router.navigate` function. This will either push a new page onto the stack or unwinding to an existing route on the stack. However, you can also call `router.push` to explicitly push a new page onto the stack, `router.back` to go back to the previous page, or `router.replace` to replace the current page on the stack.

With Expo Router, you refer to pages by their URL, or their position relative to the **app** folder. Check out the following file structure and how you would navigate to each page:

<FileTree
  files={[
    ['app/index.tsx', '`router.navigate("/")`'],
    ['app/about.tsx', '`router.navigate("/about")`'],
    ['app/profile/index.tsx', '`router.navigate("/profile")`'],
    ['app/profile/friends.tsx', '`router.navigate("/profile/friends")`'],
  ]}
/>
